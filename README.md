# XIVComboPlugin Expandedest
This is an expanded version of Daemitus's XIVCombo Expanded for personal use, that I am modifying for personal use by adding features that me and friends would like to use. These can be used in any fork you like, no credit needed. None of these features will be added to the original XIVCombo, so please do not bug the creator of that about it. Thank you Daemitus, attickdoor, goaaats, and everyone else who contributed to making this plugin possible. Additional thanks to ALymphocyte for coding help!

Also, this plugin is explicitly made for more advanced users; if you want something more curated, check out the original, at https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin, which you can easily install in-game from the official plugin list. If you want something in the middle between that plugin and this fork, check out https://github.com/daemitus/XIVComboPlugin.

## Old Readme

## About
XIVCombo is a plugin to allow for "one-button" combo chains, as well as implementing various other mutually-exclusive button consolidation and quality of life replacements. Some examples of the functionality it provides:
* Most weaponskill combos are put onto a single button (unfortunately not including MNK, though MNK gets a few good features too!).
* Enochian changes into Fire 4 and Blizzard 4 depending on your stacks, a la PvP Enochian.
* Hypercharge turns into Heat Blast while Overheated.
* Jump/High Jump turns into Mirage Dive while Dive Ready.
* And many, many more!

For some jobs, this frees a massive amount of hotbar space (looking at you, DRG). For most, it removes a lot of mindless tedium associated with having to press various buttons that have little logical reason to be separate.

## Installation
* Add the repo as a custom repo using /xlsettings in-game. Then, type `/xlplugins` in-game to access the plugin installer and updater. 

## In-game usage
* Type `/pcombo` to pull up a GUI for editing active combo replacements.
* Drag the named ability from your ability list onto your hotbar to use.
  * For example, to use DRK's Souleater combo, first check the box, then place Souleater on your bar. It should automatically turn into Hard Slash.
  * The description associated with each combo should be enough to tell you which ability needs to be placed on the hotbar.
  * Make sure you press "Save and close". Don't just X out.
